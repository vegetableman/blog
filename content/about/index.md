I am a programmer with an eye for design who loves engaging in all aspects related to building products.

Building or creating something allows me to indulge in world building in that it exercises all the faculties that one has, to conjure up an imaginary world for all of us to inhabit and interact.

#### Other Interests:  

<p class="margin-sm">I enjoy riding motorbikes â€” it's solitude in spectacular motion, reading, listening to podcasts and working out.</p> 

Recent read: **Infinity Powers** by Steven Strogatz.

#### This blog:

<p class="margin-sm">This blog will be mostly about programming, tools, startups and the themes surrounding it. I will be documenting my results here as well as on X. You could follow me on X: <a href=" https://X.com/vghanand" target="_blank">@vghanand</a>. </p>
